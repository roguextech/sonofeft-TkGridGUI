.. warning::

  Still working out the multi-platform bugs.

Create a fully "wired" python Tkinter GUI application in minutes with TkGridGUI.

The users main responsibility is to add application logic to the python source code created by TkGridGUI.  

TkGridGUI generates python source code for all the basic Tkinter widgets like Button, Label and Entry
as well structures such as menus, notebooks and statusbars.

Common widget bindings and StringVar objects are created by default.

TkGridGUI runs on Linux and Windows with python 2 and 3.
